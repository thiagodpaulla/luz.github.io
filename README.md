# Project
ðŸ’»

This is the design of a lamp that turns on and off by pressing the on or off button at the base of the lamp, it is also possible to turn it on and off with a mouse over the lamp, and also by double clicking on the lamp the image changes to broken.

To carry out this work, some commands were used that I thought relevant to quote:

Tre Estre is a project that works with events

Ouver Mouseouver - turn on the lamp when you move the mouse over it

âžœ Mouseleave - turns off the lamp when leaving the lamp area

Bl dblclick - Double Click to break the lamp

âžœ Change the state of the button from on to off and off to on according to the condition of the lamp.

Off Indexoff scans the string looking for another part of the string and when it doesn't find and returns the value -1, then if it finds the word broken it knows that the image is broken so it shouldn't light the lamp, so it should find a value> -1 demonstrating that the lamp is not broken thus allowing user interaction to act, when the value was not found
